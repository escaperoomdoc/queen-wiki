====== Connection of sound systems ======

There are given different options of sound systems connection.

===== Amplifier and passive speakers =====

==== Amplifier ====

Module, chosen for amplifier, is based on chip TDA7498:

{{:hw_tda7498.png?direct|}}

__Specification:__  
Input voltage: DC14-32V  
Output power: 100W x 2  
Output resistanse: 4-8Ohm  
**(?)**Lines type: D type 
Chip: TDA7498  
Harmonic ratio: PO = 1 Wt/0.05%  
Frequency range: 18-100 kHz 
**(?)**Switching frequency: 360 kHz
Signal/noise ratio: 110dB  
Measures: 96x64x25mm  
Output power: 100W + 100W (VCC+32V,RL=4Ohm,thd=10%) 
Use of an differentiated input for noise reducing of common mode **(?)**
Has fault pattern**(?)** and silent(noiseless) mode, intelligent protection features and overheaat protection function 


==== Speakers ====

As a speakers there are used simple car speakers:

__Specifications__  
Rating (nominal) **?** power: >50W  
Max power: >300W  
Frequency range: 50Hz-5kHz  
Impendance: 4Ohm  


==== General scheme of module conection ====

{{:layout:hw_tda7498_layout.png?direct|}}

As a power supply there is used an ACDC source with specifications:  
Output voltage: 24V  
Power: at least 200W  
considering, that declared power is generated at 32V, in our case (24V) amplifier power will not be 100W for a channel, it will be a bit lesser.

To connect an amplifier with output of audio devices, such as a phone, raspberry pi or sound card, it is nessesary to additionally buy cable-adapter minijack(m)-RCA(m):

==== Speakers connection options====

We offer 3 options of speakers connection: 

{{:hw-sound-layout-1.png?direct|}}

**Option-1.** Two speakers are connected with an amplifier, each one is connected individually (separate channels). In that case, every speaker will be supplied with maximum power. **Attention! To connect two speakers, nominal power of every speaker should be more (not less), than 100W**. 


**Option-2.** Two speakers are connected series to every channel. Under this scheme the power of the amplifier will fall twice as the total *current sink* **?** resistance of the channel  will be 80hm, but not 40hm as it is declared.


**Option-3.** Four speakers are connected series-parallel to every channel. It allows to take the maximum power from the amplifier and provide the maximum sound coverage**?**.
