====== QUEEN BOARD ======

**Queen Board** purpose is to control escape room electronics and handle various sensors. **Queen Board** is included in the base **Queen** package. Specification:

· 15 relay channels (RELAY): max 10A – 250V for AC / 10A – 30V for DC;  
· 15 PWM power switches (PWM): max 24 for VDC - 20A;  
· 15 channels of digital IN (DIN): pulled up to 5V, switching GND;  
· 15 channels of ADC with built-in potentiometer 0-100kOhm to register analog voltage 0-5V or handle resistance sensors;  
· RS232 as a communication interace.

**Queen Board** has total 60 channels ( 30 for input and 30 for output ) and usually it's enough to control majority of escape rooms. In a case of insuffient queen board channel, there is an opportunity to put another one.

**Queen Board** size is approximately 30cm x 20cm (A4 sheet), power voltage is 12V; we used Arduino Mega 2560 as a processor unit. In a case of Arduino Mega 2560 damaging, it can be easily replaced by another one. To communicate with **Queen Board** use RS232 interface, i.e. **[USR-TCP232-410S](hw_setup_usr_tcp232_410s_eng)** in accordance with **[queen mounting guide](cs_mount_eng)**.
