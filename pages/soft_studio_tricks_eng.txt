====== Queen Studio Tricks  ======

some studio hidden tricks are described here...


===== 1. Room model editor  =====

This chapter concerns only room model editing in the base studio window.  


==== 1.1. Parameter hwtype variants ====

Parameter 'hwtype' on electrical components and adapters can be used as following...  


=== 1.1.1. DIN's hwtype ===

DIN can call macroeffect when it becomes triggerhigh.  
__Syntax__: **macro:filename.mef** - will play the filname.mef as the macroeffect file, when din is triggered high.  
__Example__: **macro:my\_macro1.mef** - will play my_macro1.mef when din is triggered high.  


=== 1.1.2. AIN's hwtype ===

AIN's hwtype can specify minumum, maximum and trigger parameters.  
__Syntax__: **ain:min:max:level:range:timeout** - set min and max are the minimum and maximum ranges of the ain; level, range and timeout can be interpreted as: if the value of ain is more than level-range and less than level+range for the period of the timeout milliseconds, ain goes to the trigger high.  
__Example__: **ain:0:500:100:20:250** - will set up ain range [0,500] and it will be triggered high if the value between 80 and 120 for the period of 250 milliseconds.  


==== 1.1.3. PWM's hwtype ====

PWM's hwtype can specify minumum and maximum.  
__Syntax__: **pwm:min:max** - set min and max are the minimum and maximum ranges of the ain.  
__Example__: **pwm:0:5** - will set up ain range [0,5] for the pwm.  


==== 1.2. Use queen board analog input as the digital one ====

Imagine, you plug a button, reed, limit switch or any active barrier sensor with states disabled/enabled to the analog input due to the digital inputs (din) were expired on the QUEEN BOARD. You will have to create a **ain** object to handle this sensor and you will have an uncofortable interpretation: near 0 - disabled state, near 1023 - enabled state. QUEEN software have a feature to read analog value as digital for such cases. For example, limit switch is connected to the analog pin 13 (i.e. using schematic AIN-PASSIVE). Create a **din** object, specify board the limit switch connected to, and set it's index as **A13** (or a13 - it's not case sensitive). This will force queen_room read analog 13 input as digital and it will take value **from 13th analog input, but not digital**: values 0-511 will be interpreted as disabled state and values 512-1023 - as enabled state and it makes possible to use digital features like triggering for any analog input.  


===== 2. Macroeffects editor  =====

This chapter concerns only macroeffects editing.  


==== 2.1. Option 'fade' ====

**Fade** option allows to change value of several parameters smoothly. For this moment queen allows to fade audio volume and pwm value. To implement this create a **fade** action in the macroeffect, select an object from the list (volume or pwm) and specify **fade** options:  
__Syntax__: **algorythm:beginvalue:endvalue:timeofchange** - will change smoothly from the //beginvalue// till the //endvalue// for a period of time //timeofchange// milliseconds; algoryhtm can be: lin - linear, exp - exponential, log - logorifmics; for this moment only linear algorythm is implemented.  
__Example__ for pwm1: **lin:0:255:3000** - will change pwm1 value from 0 to 255 within 3 seconds.   
__Example__ for pwm1: **lin:100:50:500** - will change pwm1 value from 100 to 50 within 0.5 seconds.   
__Example__ for volume: **lin:10:75:1500** - will change sound volume from 10 to 75 within 1.5 seconds.
