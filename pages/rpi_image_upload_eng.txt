Attention! Master PC (laptop) must be in the same subnet as raspberry (192.168.100.x), for example, 192.168.100.2.  
Download VNC viewer by the link below:

[VNC Viewer](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Am_hkdn5bouSg3VY2tIxuGJWQBJh)

run it on your laptop or PC and create new connection  (File->New connection):  
- VNC Server: 192.168.100.10  
- Name – 192.168.100.10  
- press “OK”  
- if dialog box «Identity Check. Duplicate VNC Server identity» is appeared, ignore it by pressing “Continue”  
- if dialog box «Unencrypted connection» is appeared, ignore it, setting check «Don’t warn me about this again on this computer» and press «Continue»

**Expanding image size to the SD-card full capacity**  
Image size is approximately 3.6Gb, but the SD card has a bigger size (up to 16Gb). To allow OS use all SD-card capacity it is required to expand file system size. To implement this open console and enter the command:  

>sudo raspi-config  

implement the next steps:    
- open «Expand Filesystem» in the menu, then press «OK»        
- select «Finish» (by pressing twice “tab” key) and then press “enter”    
- «Would you like to reboot now?» - press “OK”
