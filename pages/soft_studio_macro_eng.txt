Names of macroeffects, presented below **top toolbar**, are opened  (16, 14, 15, 17 in this example). File that is "**bigger**" than others is highlighted and ready to change (16 in the examble). Files might be highlighted with **grey** and **red** colours. **Grey** - file is saved as it was opened (17 in the example), **red** - file is saved in a different way, that means, that was changed and not saved (14, 15, 16 in that example).  

Macroeffect is a pack of effects that have parameter:

|select|no(changes if "type" is changed)|graphic image of object type  |
|time|no(depends on "offset" parameter and previous "time" value)|start time of an effect|
|offset|yes|change time|
|type|yes|choose an object type|
|object|yes/no(depends on "type")|choose an object in the room|
|value|yes/no(depends on "type")|value of an parameter (for example, link to a file or volume of sound)|  


Coloumn **select** has 6 images, 1 for each type (coloumn type)- dummy, reset, out, send, 1 common for pwm & strobo, one common for play, volume, stop.  
Coloumn **time** needs to be filled like: **00:00.0** , **HH:MM.S** H - hours, MM - minutes, S - 1/10 second.
Coloumn **offset**- the first effect **(begin)**, it can't be changed, always 00:00.0. 
Then, to change starting time of an effet, you need to push a button with the "wavy" line.  {{:screen:macro-editor-center_offset.jpg|}}, then the popup window appears {{:screen:macro-editor-center_offset-var.jpg?direct|&30}}, where, choosing the **offset time**, appears another window

Choosing **same time**, all the changes will be dissmissed, the addition of time will be resetted. **If you'll input wrong time signature, the system will correct it** (for example, input of 70 minutes will turn it to 1 hour 10 minutes).  
Coloumn **type**- object type, choosing the type, by using arrow, we'll recieve:

Click on an any existing window causes another to appear: {{:screen:macro-editor-3_actions.jpg?direct|}}, where **delete item** & **dublicate item**, like at the bottom toolbar. **add item** gives more opportunities {{:screen:macro-editor-3_actions_add.jpg?direct|}} than the bottom toolbar, there are all the functions, like in an offset coloumn (**same time**, **offset time**), и функция **absolute time**- выбрав её появится окно
