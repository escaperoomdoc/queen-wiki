====== Raspberry Pi file transfer (FTP) and security shell (SSH) client setup guide ======

**Attention! We assume, that IP-address of Raspberry Pi is 192.168.100.10 (default). If you changed this IP-address, you should use it instead of the default one.**

**1. File transfer (SFTP) utility installation**  
We will use special utility xftp to implement file transfer, download it by link below:

[xftp](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Am_hkdn5bouShAMvxxxOMKYij_GX)

Install the application and open it. Press “New” button and apply the following settings:

''
FTP Site parameters:  
Name = 192.168.100.10  
Host = 192.168.100.10  
Protocol = SFTP  
Port Number = 22  
Proxy Server = None  
Login parameters:  
Use authentification agent = NO  
Method = Password  
User Name = pi  
Password = raspberry  
''

After setup press mouse double click on recently created connection and new windows must  appear. It is consisted of two panels: left one contains a file system of the local PC (laptop), and the right one - file system of the target raspberry pi. This is a way for file exchange.


**2. Remote command line utility installation (SSH).**  
We will use special utility (xshell) to implement SSH (remote control using special generic unix console), download it by link below:

[xshell](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Am_hkdn5bouSg3APqv7imNzFDFk3)

Install the application and open it. Press “New” button and apply the following settings:

''
Connection:  
Name = 192.168.100.10  
Protocol = SSH  
Host = 192.168.100.10  
Port Number = 22  
Authentification:  
Method = Password  
User Name = pi  
Password = raspberry  
''

After setup press mouse double click on recently created connection and new SSH windows must  appear.
